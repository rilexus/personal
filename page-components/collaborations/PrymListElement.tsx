          From elastic braids to pins, from zip fasteners to the revolution of
          the knitting pin: Prym Consumer is an indispensable part of the
          international world of needlework and Home Decor - and has been so for
          more than 130 years. Closely associated with Prym: the press fastener
          - an accessory that has changed peopleâ€™s lives, unobtrusively but
          lastingly - today supplemented by everything you need for needlework
          and dressmaking.
